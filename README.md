# code_breaker

This app is a fun way to pass the time when you are bored. The application generates a random code, that you need to guess before the timer runs out, and the bomb explodes. A green light indicates that you clicked the correct button, and a red light indicates that you pressed the wrong button. When you make a mistake the pattern resets, but remains the same. Each time you guess the pattern correctly, the light turns yellow, indicating that you diffused the bomb, and can proceed to the next level.
